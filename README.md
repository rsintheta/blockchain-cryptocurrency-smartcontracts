# Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Smart Contracts

These projects are my experimentation with blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and the solidity smart contract scripts. By the end there will be two implementeations of the blockchain, one in python and one in javascript and node.js. There will also be a collection of solidity smart contract scripts that I will be using to further explore smart contract programming.

Many thanks to Hadelin de Ponteves for his lectures on blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contract intuition, as well as David Joseph Katz.
